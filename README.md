# Galaga
Simple game inspired by Galaga written in C for a class project.

Requires VisualBoyAdvance to play the game.

Move left and right with the left and right arrow buttons. Fire your weapon with the up arrow. After all of the aliens are defeated, you move on to the next level for a greater challenge.

The status bar at the bottom of the screen keeps track of the number of ships you have remaining, the number of aliens you have defeated, and the current level.

Try to kill as many aliens as possible without losing all of your ships!
